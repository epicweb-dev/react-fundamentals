workshop repo to teach you the fundamentals of ReactJS!

## Pre-Workshop Instructions/Requirements

In order for us to maximize our efforts during the workshop, please do the
following:

- [ ] Setup the project (follow the setup instructions below) (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be
      using (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Watch
      [Use Zoom for KCD Workshops](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-use-zoom-for-kcd-workshops)
      (~8 minutes).
- [ ] Watch
      [Setup and Logistics for KCD Workshops](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-setup-and-logistics-for-kcd-workshops)
      (~24 minutes). Please do NOT skip this step.
- [ ] Attend my
      [Modern JavaScript Workshop](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/modern-javascript)
      or have the equivalent experience with modern JavaScript APIs.
- [ ] Have experience with HTML, CSS, and DOM APIs.

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you.

## Workshop Outline

Here are the topics we'll be covering:

- Create DOM with JavaScript, React, and JSX
- Create Custom Components
- Styling
- Simple Forms (form submission)
- Dynamic Forms (client-side form validation)
- Controlled Forms (form state management)
- Rendering Lists of Data

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v8 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v1 or greater (or [npm][npm] v6 or greater)

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
yarn --version # or npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

You should be able to work through the entire workshop in the browser. This is
actually the recommended approach as it requires absolutely no setup whatsoever.
Go to
[this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals)
and you should be good to go.

[![Edit react-fundamentals](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals)

If you'd rather be able to work through the workshop on your own computer, then
follow the following instructions.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals.git
cd react-fundamentals
npm run setup --silent
```

This may take a few minutes. **It will ask you for your email.** This is
optional and just automatically adds your email to the links in the project to
make filling out some forms easier If you get any errors, please read through
them and see if you can find out what the problem is. You may also want to look
at [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). If you can't work it out on your own
then please [file an issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the
commands you ran (even if it's a lot).

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://react-fundamentals.netlify.com/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.

**Your goal will be to go into each test, swap the final version for the
exercise version in the import, and make the tests pass**

## Helpful Emoji üê® üí∞ üíØ ü¶â üìú üí£ üö®

Each exercise has comments in it to help you get through the exercise. These fun
emoji characters are here to help you.

- **Kody the Koala Bear** üê® will tell you when there's something specific you
  should do
- **Marty the Money Bag** üí∞ will give you specific tips (and sometimes code)
  along the way
- **Hannah the Hundred** üíØ will give you extra challenges you can do if you
  finish the exercises early.
- **Olivia the Owl** ü¶â will give you useful tidbits/best practice notes and a
  link for elaboration and feedback.
- **Dominic the Document** üìú will give you links to useful documentation
- **Berry the Bomb** üí£ will be hanging around anywhere you need to blow stuff
  up (delete code)
- **Alfred the Alert** üö® will occasionally show up in the test failures with
  potential explanations for why the tests are failing.

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>"npm run setup" command not working</summary>

Here's what the setup script does. If it fails, try doing each of these things
individually yourself:

```
# verify your environment will work with the project
node ./scripts/verify

# install dependencies
npm install

# verify the project is ready to run
npm run build
npm run test:coverage
```

If any of those scripts fail, please try to work out what went wrong by the
error message you get. If you still can't work it out, feel free to [open an
issue][issue] with _all_ the output from that script. I will try to help if I
can.
