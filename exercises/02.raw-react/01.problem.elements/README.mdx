# Create React Elements

👨‍💼 Let's convert this to use React! But don't worry, we won't be doing any JSX just
yet... You're going to use raw React APIs here.

In modern applications you'll get React and React DOM files from a "package
registry" like [npm](https://npmjs.com) ([react](https://npm.im/react) and
[react-dom](https://npm.im/react-dom)).

To keep things as simple as possible in these first exercises, we'll be
importing the file `public/react.js` at `/react.js` and
`public/react-dom/client.js` at `/react-dom/client.js`. Those files re-export
the packages from [esm.sh](https://esm.sh).

Here's a simple example of the API:

```typescript
import { createElement } from '/react.js'
import { createRoot } from '/react-dom/client.js'

const elementProps = { id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!' }
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = createElement(elementType, elementProps)

const root = createRoot(rootElement)
root.render(reactElement)
```

    🦉 As a reminder, in a typical application, you're import will be something
    like

```ts nonumber nolang
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
```

    With that, a build tool or `importmap` will handle resolving that to the
    correct path.

The "props" in `elementProps` above is short for "properties" and they're a
foundational part of React elements. You can think of the element type as a
blueprint for the kind of React component to create and the props are the inputs
for when React actually creates that element.

`children` is a special prop. You can pass a single element like above, or an
array of children (if there's more than one). You can also pass the children as
any number of additional arguments:

```typescript
const elementProps = { id: 'element-id' }
const child1 = 'Hello'
const child2 = ' '
const child3 = 'world!'
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = createElement(
	elementType,
	elementProps,
	child1,
	child2,
	child3,
)
createRoot(rootElement).render(reactElement)
```

Alright! Let's do this!

	💰 Tip: `console.log` the `reactElement` to see what it looks like. You might
	find it kinda interesting!
