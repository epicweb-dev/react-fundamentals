# Create React Elements

üë®‚Äçüíº Let's convert this to use React! But don't worry, we won't be doing any JSX just
yet... You're going to use raw React APIs here.

In modern applications, you typically get React and React DOM files from a "package registry",
like [npm](https://npmjs.com) where packages we use are ([react](https://npm.im/react) and
[react-dom](https://npm.im/react-dom)).

<callout-info class="aside">
	A package registry is a centralized repository where developers can publish
	and share reusable code packages.

To keep things simple for these exercises, we'll import React from slightly different locations:

- `public/react.js` (accessed at `/react.js`)
- `public/react-dom/client.js` (accessed at `/react-dom/client.js`)

These files use a service called [esm.sh](https://esm.sh) to provide the React packages.

Don't worry too much about [esm.sh](https://esm.sh) for now - it's just helping us load React easily in these exercises.

Here's a simple example of how to use the React createElement API:

```typescript
import { createElement } from '/react.js'
import { createRoot } from '/react-dom/client.js'

const elementProps = { id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!' }
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = createElement(elementType, elementProps)

const root = createRoot(rootElement)
root.render(reactElement)
```

<callout-info>

    ü¶â As a reminder, in a typical application, your import will be something
    like

```ts nonumber nolang
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
```

    With that, a build tool or `importmap` will handle resolving that to the
    correct path.

The "props" in `elementProps` above is short for "properties". Props are a key concept
in React - they're the way we pass data into our elements. You can think of the element
type as a blueprint for the kind of React component to create, and the props are the
inputs that customize that element.

`children` is a special prop in React. It represents the content inside an element.
You have a few ways to specify children:

1. As a prop (like in the first example above)
2. As multiple arguments to `createElement`
3. As an array

Here's an example showing the last two methods:

```typescript
const elementProps = { id: 'element-id' }
const elementType = 'h1'

// Method 2: Multiple arguments
const reactElement1 = createElement(
	elementType,
	elementProps,
	'Hello',
	' ',
	'world!',
)

// Method 3: Array of children
const children = ['Hello', ' ', 'world!']
const reactElement2 = createElement(elementType, elementProps, children)

createRoot(rootElement).render(reactElement1) // or reactElement2
```

Alright! Let's put this into practice!

	like. You might find the structure interesting!
