# Compiling JSX

<callout-warning>
	Normally you'll compile all of your code at build-time before you ship your
	application to the browser, but because Babel is written in JavaScript we can
	actually run it _in_ the browser to compile our code on the fly and that's
	what we'll do in this exercise.

👨‍💼 Let's add a script tag for Babel, then we'll update our own script tag to
tell Babel to compile it for us on the fly. When you're done, you should notice
the compiled version of the code appears in the `<head>` of the DOM (which you
can inspect using DevTools).
