			// 🐨 on the script tag above, change `type="module"`
			// to `type="text/babel"` and add data-type="module" so babel will compile
			// this code as a module script for the browser to run.

			// 🐨 babel compiles JSX to "React.createElement" instead of simply "createElement"
			// so change this import to: import * as React from '/react.js'
			import * as React from '/react.js'
			import { createRoot } from '/react-dom/client.js'

			const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')

			// 🐨 With babel compiling this code, you can now re-implement this using JSX!
			const element = <div className='container'>Hello World</div>

			// 💰 there are a few subtle differences between JSX and HTML. One such
			// difference is how you apply a class to an element in JSX is by using
			// `className` rather than `class`!
			// 📜 You can learn the differences between JSX and HTML syntax from the React docs here:
			// https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common
