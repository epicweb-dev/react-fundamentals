# Compiling JSX

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/compiling-jsx/solution" />

🦉 Let's break down the key changes in our `script` tag:

1. `type="text/babel"` and `data-type="module"`:

   - `type="text/babel"` tells Babel to transpile this script, allowing us to use JSX and modern JavaScript features.
   - `data-type="module"` indicates that this script should be treated as a module after Babel transpilation. This enables us to use `import` statements.

   We use both instead of just `type="module"` because browsers don't natively understand JSX. Babel needs to transform our code first, then it can be treated as a module.

2. Importing React:
   We've changed from:

   ```javascript
   import { createElement } from '/react.js'
   ```

   to:

   ```javascript
   import * as React from '/react.js'
   ```

   This imports all exports from React as a namespace called `React`. It's beneficial because:

   - It provides access to all React APIs, not just `createElement`.
   - When using JSX, the transpiler will convert JSX elements to `React.createElement` calls, so we need the `React` namespace in scope.

👨‍💼 Great! Now we're ready to start using JSX in our HTML file!
