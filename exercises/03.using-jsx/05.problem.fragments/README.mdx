# Fragments

🦉 One feature of JSX that you'll find useful is called
["React Fragments"](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment). It's a special
kind of component from React which allows you to position two elements
side-by-side rather than just nested.

Let's say we wanted to do the same thing as above, except we didn't want the
`container` `div`. So, we wanted to just create:

```html
<p>Here's Sam's favorite food:</p>
<ul class="sams-food">
	<li>Green eggs</li>
	<li>Ham</li>
</ul>
```

In React, we do this with `<React.Fragment>`. Replace the
`<div className="container">` with a fragment and inspect the DOM to notice that
the elements are both rendered as direct children of `root`.

<callout-info class="aside">
	💰 TIP: Fragments are common enough that there's a syntax shortcut for them.
	You can open with `<>` and close with `</>`, so:
</callout-info>

```tsx
element = <React.Fragment>this is in a fragment</React.Fragment>
// is the same as:
element = <>this is in a fragment</>
```

👨‍💼 We want to get rid of the `<div className="container">` we have in there, but
we need to keep the `<p>` and `<ul>` next to each other. Figure out how to make
that work.

💯 As a little extra part of this, try to figure out why `<React.Fragment>` is
needed at all. Might help if you look at what this looks like using
`createElement` rather than JSX. As I said, understanding how JSX compiles
to `createElement` really helps improve your capabilities with JSX!
