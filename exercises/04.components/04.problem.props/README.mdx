# Props

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/props" />

👨‍💼 You are the commander of your component's API. The API for your component is
"props" which is the object your component function accepts as an argument.

So now, we're going to use a `Calculator` component that can display an
equation and its solution, like so:

```tsx
element = <Calculator left={1} operator="+" right={2} />
// should render:
// <div>
//   <code>
//     1 + 2 = <output>3</output>
//   </code>
// </div>
```

Let's get some more practice with custom components.
