# Satisfies

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/satisfies" />

üë®‚Äçüíº Ok, so repeating ourselves there is not awesome. The problem is that we want
to enforce the value of our `operations` object, but to do that we either have
to widen the type of our `key` or list it explicitly as we're doing. This is
because when you cast your object to a type, TypeScript widens your type as far
as that cast. Here's a simple example of the problem:

```ts
type ValidCandies = 'twix' | 'snickers' | 'm&ms'
const candy: ValidCandies = 'twix'
// candy is 'twix' | 'snickers' | 'm&ms'
```

What we need is some way to enforce the values of our object, without having to
annotate our object. We can do this using TypeScript's
[`satisfies`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html#the-satisfies-operator) syntax.
For example:

```ts
type ValidCandies = 'twix' | 'snickers' | 'm&ms'
const candy = 'twix' satisfies ValidCandies
// candy is 'twix'
```

See? No type widening! Wahoo!

	Before `satisfies` came out, we had to use a "Constrained Identity Function"
	(pattern coined by yours truly). Learn more in **[How to write a Constrained
	Identity Function (CIF) in
