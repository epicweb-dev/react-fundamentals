# TypeScript

TypeScript is an enormously valuable team productivity, code quality, and
confidence tool that I strongly recommend you use to build any React application
you plan making maintainable. As you're working with TypeScript and getting
angry at all the red squiggles it puts in your code, keep this in mind:

You can think of TypeScript as that
[brutally honest friend](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1715562350835855396)
who isn't afraid to tell you about the spinach in your teeth. It's not the
friend's fault that you've got spinach in your teeth. It's your fault. You
should be thanking TypeScript, not cursing it.

Remember, in exercise 4 we learned
[what a React component](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1763606427028136131)
is:

> Components are functions which accept an object called "props" and return
> something that is renderable

Because of this, they don't require any special considerations when applying
TypeScript type annotations to them. You treat React component functions the
same way you treat regular functions. Because of this, the major battle for
folks using TypeScript with React is:

1. Improving their TypeScript skills
2. Learning the React-specific types available

ðŸ“œ I advise having the
[React+TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react)
repo open as a reference while you're getting used to using TypeScript and
React. Another terrific resource is
[Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/) which has a lot of great
free resources which go much deeper than we do in this exercise.

With that said, here's a quick intro to adding type annotations to functions:

```tsx
// here's a regular JS function that accepts a user
// which might have a name property
function getName(user) {
	return user.name ?? 'Unknown'
}

// here's how you'd type that user object to say it has an optional name property:
type User = { name?: string }

// and here's how you'd tell TypeScript that the user parameter is a User object
function getName(user: User) {
	return user.name ?? 'Unknown'
}

// and if you'd like to, you can specify the return type explicitly as well
// (though it is inferred):
function getName(user: User): string {
	return user.name ?? 'Unknown'
}
```

Let's look at a quick example of adding TypeScript to a simple (and familiar)
React component:

```tsx
function Message(props) {
	return <div className="message">{props.children}</div>
}

// We could say:
type MessageProps = { children: string }
function Message(props: MessageProps) {
	return <div className="message">{props.children}</div>
}
// that would allow: <Message>Hello World</Message>
// but not: <Message><span>Hello</span> <span>World</span></Message>

// The React types have a ReactNode, which is the recommended choice for the children prop:
type MessageProps = { children: React.ReactNode }
function Message(props: MessageProps) {
	return <div className="message">{props.children}</div>
}

// keep in mind that you don't *have* to give your props a name.
// You can inline them as well. This works just the same as above:
function Message(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	return <div className="message">{props.children}</div>
}

// and you can destructure as well (this is what I do most of the time):
function Message({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	return <div className="message">{children}</div>
}

// mix-and-match:
type MessageProps = { children: React.ReactNode }
function Message({ children }: MessageProps) {
	return <div className="message">{children}</div>
}
```

ðŸ¦‰ It's great to have your code type checked, but not at the expense of
progressing and learning. If you get totally stuck on something, then I suggest
you tell TypeScript to quiet down and come back to it later when you're more
experienced or want to focus on it. You can do this like so:

```typescript
// @ts-expect-error TypeScript is complaining about this next line.
// Something about magic not existing.
// I don't know how to fix this right now and AI Assistants were unhelpful...
// Come back later.
make.magic()
```

Don't worry if you struggle with TypeScript at first, the more you use it, the
better you'll get at it, just like anything else.

<callout-info>
	Note: We're moving from the `*.html` files to `*.tsx` files. This is more
	real-world and also your editor likely supports TypeScript better within
	TypeScript files rather than HTML files. From here on out, the `index.tsx`
	file will be loaded onto the page automatically. We'll also get live reload of
	the browser as we save changes which will be quite nice. The workshop app is a
	little magical, but you'll find `createRoot(rootElement).render(element)`
	calls in each of the files, just like we were doing in the previous exercises.
