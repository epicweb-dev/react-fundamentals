# Styling

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/intro-to-styling" />

There are two primary ways to style react components

1. Inline styles with the `style` prop
2. Regular CSS with the `className` prop

Before we get into those, you need to know something about element properties
and HTML attributes.

## Element properties and HTML attributes

In HTML, you have elements and attributes. For example, the `div` element has a
`class` attribute:

```html
<div class="my-class"></div>
```

In the DOM, the `div` element has a `className` property:

```html
<div id="my-div" class="my-class"></div>
<script>
	const myDiv = document.getElementById('my-div')
	console.log(myDiv.class) // undefined
	console.log(myDiv.className) // "my-class"
</script>
```

In JSX, you use the property name rather than the attribute name:

```tsx
<div className="my-class" />
```

This applies to a number of other attributes as well. For example, `for` in HTML
is `htmlFor` in DOM (and JSX). Others include `tabindex` and `readonly` (which
are, respectively, `tabIndex` and `readOnly` in JSX).

Most differences between HTML attributes and JSX props are due to the fact that
props are a reference to "properties" not "attributes", so understanding the
difference is handy!

## Inline styles

Inline styles are set differently in JSX from HTML as a result of how they are
applied to the DOM. In HTML, you'd pass a string of CSS, but you access it as an
object in the DOM:

```html
<div id="my-div" style="margin-top: 20px; background-color: blue;"></div>
<script>
	const myDiv = document.getElementById('my-div')
	console.log(myDiv.style.marginTop) // "20px"
	console.log(myDiv.style.backgroundColor) // "blue"
</script>
```

As a result, in JSX, you pass an object of CSS rather than a string:

```tsx
<div style={{ marginTop: 20, backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
```

This actually makes them much easier to work with. Though the style prop has
some significant limitations (like lack of media queries and pseudo-selectors),
so it's not always the best choice.

Note that in react the `{{` and `}}` is actually a combination of a JSX
expression and an object expression. The same example above could be written
like so:

```tsx
const myStyles = {marginTop: 20, backgroundColor: 'blue'}
<div style={myStyles} />
```

</callout-warning>

Note also that the property names are `camelCased` rather than `kebab-cased`.
This matches the `style` property of DOM nodes (which is a
[`CSSStyleDeclaration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration)
object).

## Class names

The most common mechanism for styling web applications is through the use of CSS
and class names.

As mentioned earlier, in HTML, you apply a class name to an element with the
`class` attribute. In JSX, you use the `className` prop:

```tsx
<div className="my-class" />
```

Then you'll load a CSS file onto the page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

And that can contain the styles for `.my-class`:

```css
.my-class {
	margin-top: 20px;
	background-color: blue;
}
```
