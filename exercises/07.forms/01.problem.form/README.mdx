# Form

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/form" />

👨‍💼 We want to have an intake form which accepts a number of bits of information
for a new user. They'll need a username to start with, so let's just render that
and the submit button for now.

	🦉 You may notice a full page refresh when you submit the form. We'll talk
