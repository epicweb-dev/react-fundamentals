# Form Action

🧝‍♂️ I've added some backend code that will handle our form submission. It's at
`api/onboarding`. You can find it in <InlineFile file="api.server.ts" />.

	Note: the `api.server.ts` file is some magic from the Workshop app to make it
	so we can test things out with a backend server without having to actually set
	up a backend server. It's not something you'd use in a real app.

👨‍💼 Great! So we want the user's form submission to be sent along to
`api/onboarding`. By default, when a form is submitted, the browser will send
the form data to the current page's URL. We can change this by adding an
`action` attribute to the form element:

```html
<form action="path/to/backend/route">
	<!-- ... -->
</form>
```

Go ahead and add an `action` attribute to the form element.

🦉 You may notice a full page refresh when you submit the form. We'll talk about
this in a future step.
