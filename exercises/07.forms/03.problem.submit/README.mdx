# Submission

🐨 For this exercise, I want you to read through these instructions and complete
things step by step as you read the instructions so you can observe the changes
as they come. There aren't a lot of steps, but it's important you understand
each one.

👨‍💼 Right now, when we submit the form, we get a full page refresh and what we
entered ends up in the URL. This is the default behavior of forms. This works
well for a search page, but it's certainly not optimal for a form like this one
for two reasons:

1. We don't want to see the data in the URL (like the password) as that can
   appear in logs, be saved in the browser history, and is visible to anyone
   looking over our shoulder.
2. We generally don't want a full-page refresh as that can be jarring to the
   user and forces the browser to re-evaluate all our client-side JavaScript.

To handle the first problem, let's switch to using `POST` instead of the default
form HTTP `method` (which is `GET`). This will send the data in the body of the
request instead of in the URL:

```tsx
<form action="POST"></form>
```

🐨 Go ahead and make that change now, then come on back for the rest...

Now, when you submit the form, you'll notice two things:

1. We get an error because we don't have a server to handle the form submission.
2. The page still refreshes.

Before we get to the solution though, I want you to check the network tab in
your dev tools and see what the request looks like because we have a third
problem. You'll notice that the `Content-Type` header is
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the body of the request is a query
string. This is the default behavior of forms and it's a fine default for simple
forms.

The problem for us is we're trying to upload a file which cannot be reasonably
represented by a string in the URL (especially for large files). You'll notice
if you select a file that the file is represented by its name, and that is all
the server will get which is just not very helpful.

We can change that by adding a `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute to the
form. This will change the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data` and
the body of the request will be a `multipart/form-data` request. This is the
same type of request that you'd get if you were uploading a file which is what
we're doing with the photo.

🐨 Now, update the `form` to have the appropriate `enctype` attribute for file
uploads:

```tsx
<form action="POST" encType="multipart/form-data"></form>
```

Great, so now if you check the network tab you'll find that the file is
actually uploaded properly.

Now let's get to those other two issues of full page refresh and no server to
handle the form submission. We're going to side-step both problems by handling
the form submission through JavaScript. In a real application, you would want to
make sure your server can handle those form submissions (for progressive
enhancement reasons). But you'll also want to still prevent default to avoid the
full-page refresh.

This is where the [Remix](https://remix.run) web framework comes in to handle
all that for you. But in this React-focused workshop, we're not going to cover
that. Instead, we'll just prevent default and log the form data out to the
console:

```tsx
<form
	action="POST"
	onSubmit={event => {
		event.preventDefault()
		// ...
	}}
></form>
```

🐨 Go ahead and make that change now, then come on back for the rest...

Now you shouldn't be getting a full-page refresh (and you'll also not be getting
the form submission either). So now, we just need to get the form data and log
that out. To do that, we'll use
[the `FormData` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData):

```tsx
const formData = new FormData(form)
// The browser doesn't display form values very well when you console.log(formData)
// so you can do this:
console.log(Object.fromEntries(formData))
// this will create an object out of the properties in the formData so you can
// more easily see what's in there. Keep in mind that formData can have multiple
// values for a single key, so you don't generally want to rely on this method
// for production code.
```

You can get the form from the submit event via
[`event.currentTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget).

🐨 Go ahead and make that change now, then come on back for the rest...

Now, when you submit the form, you should see the form data logged out to the
console. You can also check the network tab to see that the form submission is
not happening so we're not getting an error and there is no refresh.

Great work!
