# Input Types

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/input-types" />

👨‍💼 We need quite a few more fields. Luckily the web platform has some great
input types we can use. 📜 Check out all the
[standard `<input />` types here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#input_types).

For us, we need to add types for the password, photo, favorite color, and start
date. Please add inputs for those fields.

	🦉 You may notice a full page refresh when you submit the form. We'll talk
	about this in a future step.
