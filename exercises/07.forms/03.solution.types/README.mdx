# Input Types

👨‍💼 Great! Now our users will have more fields available to them as they're
filling out this form. But there's something weird going on with the form
submission so let's look at that next.

🦉 While the web platform has a lot of really great input types, not all of them
match the style you're going for in your app. And these can be difficult (or in
some cases even impossible) to style. There are efforts in standards bodies to
solve these problems, but until then, you should look into great UI libraries
like [Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and
[React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria) which
handle these issues and allow you to customize the style much more easily.
