# Composition

üë®‚Äçüíº You'll notice that right now our onboarding form isn't showing up at all.
That's because someone made a typo... But errors like this could happen for any
number of reasons (data issue, API version change, network error, etc.). So we
should definitely handle errors in our app.

Let's start by wrapping our existing `App` component in an Error Boundary to
handle any errors. We're going to have you use the `FallbackComponent` prop on
the `ErrorBoundary` so we can define our own `ErrorFallback` component.

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>{/*...*/}</ErrorBoundary>
```

Right now we have an `App` component which we render using
`ReactDOM.createRoot(rootEl).render(<App />)`, so to get our stuff wrapped
properly, we'll rename our existing `App` component (call it `OnboardingForm`) and
then make a new `App` which renders the `ErrorBoundary` around the `OnboardingForm`
component along with our `FallbackComponent` called `ErrorFallback` (which you
also have to create).

Get to it!
