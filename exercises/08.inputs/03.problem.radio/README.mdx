# Radios

👨‍💼 We need to allow the user to select the visibility of the account. It can be
either Public or Private. We could use a `<select>` here, but I don't think
that's the best option. Instead, let's use a radio group.

📜 You can [learn about radio groups on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio)

What's interesting about radio groups is that each radio group can contain
multiple inputs that share the same name. Only one of them can be selected at
a time. Each radio input needs its own `label`. To label the entire group, you
can use a `<fieldset>` and a `<legend>`.

	Note: Similar to checkboxes, to set the default value, you can set the
	`checked` attribute to the input you want to be selected by default... but
	in React, that will make your input read-only! We'll learn more about how
	to set default values in React in a future lesson.

Similar to a select `option`, you need to set the `value` on the input to
determine what value will be sent to the server when the form is submitted.
