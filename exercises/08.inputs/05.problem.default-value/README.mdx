# Default Value

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/default-value" />

🦉 You may have noticed in the previous step we used a `value` prop. This is how
you set the value in an HTML document. React however is a little special and
supports what's called
["controlled inputs"](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)
meaning you can programmatically control the value of the input.

For this reason, when you set the `value` prop on an input like this, it means
that React will expect you keep that value up-to-date and will not allow the
user to change the value to anything other than what you have specified in the
`value` prop. Effectively, this means that if we set the `value` on one of our
fields, the user can't change it unless we do a little extra work. This is a
very useful feature we'll discuss more later on, but it has implications for our
form now, so let's address this.

The thing is, we want to default several of these fields to a value, but we
want the user to be able to change them. With the exception of the hidden input,
we can't do that with the `value` prop. So we need to use a different prop.

In React, you use the `defaultValue` prop to set the default value of an input
and the `defaultChecked` prop to set the default value of a checkbox or radio.
The `defaultValue` should be a string (or it will be coerced to a string) that
matches the format of the input.

```tsx
<input type="text" defaultValue="Hello World" />
// these give the same result:
<input type="number" defaultValue="42" />
<input type="number" defaultValue={42} />
```

If it's a date, you need to use a string, but it needs to be in the format
`YYYY-MM-DD` (because that's the format of the value when the user selects a
date). You can use the `toISOString` method on a `Date` object which gives a
string with the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`, so we can use `slice` to get
the first 10 characters:

```tsx
<input type="date" defaultValue={new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)} />
```

This applies to `select` as well. Set it the the value of the option you want to
have selected, and that one will be selected by default:

```tsx
<select defaultValue="pineapple">
	<option value="apple">Apple</option>
	<option value="banana">Banana</option>
	<option value="pineapple">Pineapple</option>
</select>
```

Checkboxes and Radios are special cases. For these, you set the `defaultChecked`
prop:

```tsx
<input type="checkbox" defaultChecked />
// and for the radio, just set defaultChecked on the one you want selected:
<input type="radio" name="fruit" value="apple" defaultChecked />
<input type="radio" name="fruit" value="banana" />
<input type="radio" name="fruit" value="pineapple" />
```

👨‍💼 So with that, please set some defaults on these form fields:

- Account Type: "Student"
- Age: 18
- Favorite Color: #002E5D
- Visibility: Public
- Waiver Signed: Checked
- Start Date: Today's date
