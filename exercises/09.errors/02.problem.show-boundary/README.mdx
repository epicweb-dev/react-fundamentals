# Other Errors

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/other-errors" />

👨‍💼 Recall previously we learned that React doesn't catch all errors for you.
We've got an error in our `onSubmit` handler like this. If you try to submit the
form, you'll notice in the console that there's an error (someone made a typo
😅). The error looks something like:

```javascript
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toUpperCase')
```

Before we fix the typo, we want to give the user better feedback for when
something like this happens (right now, they don't know it's not working and
that's terribly annoying). So what I want you to do is wrap that callback in our
own `try/catch` and then surface it to React using the `showBoundary` function
you get when you call the `useErrorBoundary` utility:

```tsx
import { useErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary'

// ... in the component
const { showBoundary } = useErrorBoundary()

// ... in the `catch` block
showBoundary(error)
```

So let's make that happen!
