# Reset

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/reset" />

👨‍💼 Sometimes errors are temporary and will go away if you just "turn it off and
on again." `react-error-boundary` supports this with a `resetErrorBoundary`
function it passes to our `FallbackComponent`. We can use this to reset the
error boundary and try again.

Once you're done, you can test it out. We've still got the typo in our
`onSubmit` handler, so go ahead and trigger the error by submitting the form,
then click the "Try again" button to see the error go away.
