# Key prop

👨‍💼 Great work. That was super weird and confusing for our users. They're much
happier now.

🦉 The key only needs to be unique within a given array. So this works
fine:

```tsx
const element = (
	<ul>
		{list.map(listItem => (
			<li key={listItem.id}>{listItem.value}</li>
		))}
	</ul>
)
```

In our example, the `value` of the input is managed by the browser, but this
has even bigger implications when we start working with our own state and
side-effects. It's a little too early to demonstrate this for you, but you
should know that when React removes a component from the DOM, it gets
"unmounted" which will trigger side-effect cleanups, and if new elements are
added then those will be "mounted" and will trigger your side-effects. This can
cause some surprising and problematic issues for your users.

So just remember the rule and always provide a `key` when rendering an array.
Later when you have more React experience, you can come back to this exercise
and expand it a bit with custom components that manage state and side-effects to
observe the problems caused when you ignore the `key`.
