# Focus State

🦉 You can observe that when we're talking about "state" we're also talking
about keyboard focus as well as what text is selected! As you play around with
this, try selecting text in the inputs and observe how the first two examples
differ from the last one. You'll notice that using the array `index` as a key is
no different from React's default behavior, so it's unlikely to fix issues if
you're having them. Best to use a unique ID. Play around with it!
