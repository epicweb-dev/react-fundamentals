# Focus State

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/focus-state/solution" />

🦉 There are some other interesting things you can do with `key`s as well (like
changing them on an element to intentionally reset the state of a component).
Feel free to play around with that if you like, but we'll be using that in a
future workshop so look forward to it!
