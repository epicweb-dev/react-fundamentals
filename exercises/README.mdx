# React Fundamentals ⚛

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/react-fundamentals-intro" />

👨‍💼 Hello! I'm Peter the Project Manager and I'm here to help you know what our
users want you to know so you can build the kind of React application they need!
In this workshop we're going to give you the foundational knowledge you need
upon which you can build your React skills.

Our users don't need much at the start of this workshop ("Hello World" is about
as far as we'll get for a bit), but they'll need more as we go along, including
custom components, type safety, styling, forms, error handling, and rendering
lists of data. We'll cover all of that and more in this series of exercises.

It's important that you understand the fundamentals of React so you can not just
use React, but _understand_ it. This will help you build better applications and
be more effective at debugging when things go wrong.

	NOTE: The first four exercises in this workshop are in `index.html` files to
	keep things as simple as possible. The JavaScript you write will be inside
	inline `<script>` tags. This is just to keep things simple for this workshop,
	but in the rest of the workshop you'll be writing TypeScript 100% to make
	things resemble real world applications.

	If the first part of this workshop is familar, you may have gone through the
	[Get Started with React
	Workshop](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/get-started-with-react) which is an
	exerpt from this workshop. If you're signed in to Epic React, your progress
	should be saved and you can continue from where you left off.
