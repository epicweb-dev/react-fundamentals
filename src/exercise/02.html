  <!-- 🐨 add React and ReactDOM on the page.
       💰 Here are script tags that'll do the job:
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.0.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.0.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  -->

  <script type="module">
    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')

    // You're going to re-implement this code using React!
    // 💣 So go ahead and delete this implementation (or comment it out for now)
    // These three lines are similar to React.createElement
    const element = document.createElement('div')
    element.textContent = 'Hello World' // 💰 in React, you set this with the "children" prop
    element.className = 'container' // 💰 in React, this is also called the "className" prop
    // This is similar to ReactDOM.createRoot().render()
    rootElement.append(element)

    // 🐨 Please re-implement the regular document.createElement code above
    // with these React API calls
    // 💰 The example in the markdown file should be a good hint for you.
