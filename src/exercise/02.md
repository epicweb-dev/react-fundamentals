# Intro to raw React APIs

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/02.md`

## Background

React is the most widely used frontend framework in the world and it's using the
same APIs that you're using when it creates DOM nodes.

> In fact,
> [here's where that happens in the React source code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ee432635724d5a50301448016caa137ac3c0a7a2/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L416)
> at the time of this writing.

React abstracts away the imperative browser API from you to give you a much more
declarative API to work with.

One important thing to know about React is that it supports multiple platforms
(for example, native mobile, native desktop, web, and even terminal and VR).
Each of these platforms has its own code necessary for interacting with that
platform, and then there's shared code between the platforms.

With that in mind, you need two JavaScript files to write React applications for
the web:

- React: responsible for creating React elements (kinda like
  `document.createElement()`)
- ReactDOM: responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM (kinda like
  `rootElement.append()`)

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/02.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.html)

Let's convert this to use React! But don't worry, we won't be doing any JSX just
yet... You're going to use raw React APIs here.

In modern applications you'll get React and React DOM files from a "package
registry" like [npm](https://npmjs.com) ([react](https://npm.im/react) and
[react-dom](https://npm.im/react-dom)). But for these first exercises, we'll use
the script files which are available on [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) and
regular script tags so you don't have to bother installing them. So in the
exercise you'll be required to add script tags for these files.

Once you include the script tags, you'll have two new global variables to use:
`React` and `ReactDOM`.

Here's a simple example of the API:

```typescript
const elementProps = {id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!'}
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(elementType, elementProps)
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
```

"Props" is short for "properties" and they're a foundational part of React
elements. You can think of the element type as a blueprint for the kind of React
component to create and the props are the inputs for when React actually creates
that element.

`children` is a special prop. You can pass a single element like above, or an
array of children (if there's more than one). You can also pass the children as
any number of additional arguments:

```typescript
const elementProps = {id: 'element-id'}
const child1 = 'Hello'
const child2 = ' '
const child3 = 'world!'
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(
  elementType,
  elementProps,
  child1,
  child2,
  child3,
)
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
```

Alright! Let's do this!

💰 Tip: `console.log` the `reactElement` to see what it looks like. You might
find it kinda interesting!

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 nesting elements

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.extra-1.html)

See if you can figure out how to write the JavaScript + React code to generate
this DOM output:

```html
<ul class="sams-food">
  <li>Green eggs</li>
  <li>Ham</li>
</ul>
```

Note also, depending on how you implement this, you may get a warning in the
developer console about needing a "key" prop. We'll get to that later.

### 2. 💯 deep nesting elements

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.extra-2.html)

Let's go a little deeper. Try to create this:

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>Here's Sam's favorite food:</p>
  <ul class="sams-food">
    <li>Green eggs</li>
    <li>Ham</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```
