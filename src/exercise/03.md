# Using JSX

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/03.md`

## Background

JSX is more intuitive than the raw React API and is easier to understand when
reading the code. It's fairly simple HTML-like syntactic sugar on top of the raw
React APIs:

```jsx
const element = <h1 id="greeting">Hey there</h1>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ compiles to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const element = React.createElement('h1', {
  id: 'greeting',
  children: 'Hey there',
})
```

Because JSX is not actually JavaScript, you have to convert it using something
called a code compiler. [Babel](https://babeljs.io) is one such tool.

🦉 Pro tip: If you'd like to see how JSX gets compiled to JavaScript,
[check out the online babel REPL here](https://babeljs.io/repl#?builtIns=App&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBArgSxgXhgHgCYIG4D40QAOAhmLgBICmANtSGgPRGm7rNkDqIATtRo-3wMseAFBA&presets=react&prettier=true).

If you can train your brain to look at JSX and see the compiled version of that
code, you'll be MUCH more effective at reading and using it! I strongly
recommend you give this some intentional practice.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/03.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.html)

Normally you'll compile all of your code at build-time before you ship your
application to the browser, but because Babel is written in JavaScript we can
actually run it _in_ the browser to compile our code on the fly and that's what
we'll do in this exercise.

So we'll include a script tag for Babel, then we'll update our own script tag to
tell Babel to compile it for us on the fly. When you're done, you should notice
the compiled version of the code appears in the `<head>` of the DOM (which you
can inspect using DevTools).

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 interpolate className and children

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-1.html)

"Interpolation" is defined as "the insertion of something of a different nature
into something else."

Let's take template literals for example:

```typescript
const greeting = 'Sup'
const subject = 'World'
const message = `${greeting} ${subject}`
```

See if you can figure out how to extract the `className` (`"container"`) and
`children` (`"Hello World"`) to variables and interpolate them in the JSX.

```jsx
const className = 'container'
const children = 'Hello World'
const element = <div className="hmmm">how do I make this work?</div>
```

📜 The react docs for JSX are pretty good:
https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

Here are a few sections of particular interest for this extra credit:

- https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx
- https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#specifying-attributes-with-jsx

### 2. 💯 spread props

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-2.html)

What if I have an object of props that I want applied to the `div` like this:

```jsx
const children = 'Hello World'
const className = 'container'
const props = {children, className}
const element = <div /> // how do I apply props to this div?
```

If we were doing raw React APIs it would be:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement('div', props)
```

Or, it could be written like this:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement('div', {...props})
```

See if you can figure out how to make that work with JSX.

### 3. 💯 deep nesting elements with JSX

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-3.html)

Remember when we created this with `React.createElement`?

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>Here's Sam's favorite food:</p>
  <ul class="sams-food">
    <li>Green eggs</li>
    <li>Ham</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

That was... intellectually stimulating 😅. Well, now try doing the same thing
using JSX. I promise it'll be more fun this time.

💰 Tip: remember `class` in JSX is `className`.

### 4. 💯 using React Fragments

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-4.html)

One feature of JSX that you'll find useful is called
["React Fragments"](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). It's a special
kind of component from React which allows you to position two elements
side-by-side rather than just nested.

Let's say we wanted to do the same thing as above, except we didn't want the
`container` `div`. So, we wanted to just create:

```html
<p>Here's Sam's favorite food:</p>
<ul class="sams-food">
  <li>Green eggs</li>
  <li>Ham</li>
</ul>
```

In React, we do this with `<React.Fragment>`. Replace the
`<div className="container">` with a fragment and inspect the DOM to notice that
the elements are both rendered as direct children of `root`.

💰 TIP: Fragments are common enough that there's a syntax shortcut for them. You
can open with `<>` and close with `</>`, so:

```tsx
element = <React.Fragment>this is in a fragment</React.Fragment>
// is the same as:
element = <>this is in a fragment</>
```

As a little extra part of this, try to figure out why `<React.Fragment>` is
needed at all. Might help if you look at what this looks like using
`React.createElement` rather than JSX. As I said, understanding how JXS compiles
to `React.createElement` really helps improve your capabilities with JSX!
